# Sudoku Solver in TCL

Our QA Cafe summer-code-challenge this year involved writing a Sudoku solver.
To make it even more fun, we had to spin the wheel of languages to see what we
had to write it in.

This solution is writtin in TCL using lists extensively.

Sample puzzles are in the puzzles/ directory.

To solve, supply the puzzle filename on the command line.

```
tclsh sudoku.tcl puzzles/puzzle.1
```
